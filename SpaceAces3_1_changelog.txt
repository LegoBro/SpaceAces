Version 3.1 Changes:

Major:

New Gamemode Killstreak:
Get 3 kills in a row to win
if you die, your kills are reset
a fun gamemode for 1v1's or even 2v2's.  It's up to you to figure out the best way to play

Kills/Killfeed:
Kills are now tracked, as well as a killfeed which displays who kills who
kills are awarded to the last person to deal direct damage
Kills also grant +1 xp each

Lobby Changes:
The lobby is so much better now...  

Minor:

Bombs now land better and deal more AOE damage
Bomber and Rocketeer have felt lackluster, and with this improvement, they should feel like they fit their purpose more.
Both have been nerfed in terms of direct-hit damage, but the AOE improvement will help greatly


Class:
Scout:
changed firerate from 5 -> 3 (lower is faster)
for a class that is entirely speed, scout shot way too slowly, maybe this will feel better

Bomber:
reduced direct-hit damage from 15 -> 10

Rocketeer:
reduced direct-hit damage from 15 -> 8

Pyro:
made fire-bomb land in a more circular pattern
increased full hit damage from 15 -> 30
Pyro didn't deal enough direct hit damage, which caused a hit and run strategy that wasn't all too fun

Shocksmith:
changed primary firerate from 15 -> 8 (lower is faster)
increased direct-hit damage from 10 -> 15
decreased aoe damage from 10 -> 5
increased effective radius of energy sap from 5 -> 10
Shocksmith felt a little slow to play as, and energy sap felt too situational
Also, I wanted shocksmith to be able to win a 1v1 and not only function in larger groups.  The higher direct damage will help with this, but prevent shocksmith from becoming too powerful

Gunner:
decreased large heal from healing 150 -> 100
Previously gunner was unkillable, so this nerf might help with that.  Gunner is supposed to feel hard to kill, but it should be possible against any class.
